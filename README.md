# Game Off 2016
## RTS Prototype

This game is an RTS prototype built in Unity over a month for the Github Game Jam by @will-hart and @SonicZentropy. We had an artist, but they didn't produce any art or leave us time to recruit a new artist, so apologies for the programmer art!

The game includes several unit and building types, a functional (if basic!) enemy AI and win/loss conditions.

The basic premise of the game is you build nanovirus heroes, and these heroes have a number of follower "creeps". Heroes can be melee or ranged. Your objective is to destroy the AI team's Cortex. You can capture resource points throughout the map to gather DNA to build new creeps, buildings and upgrades.

You can build towers or factories. When you first place a building it cannot produce or fire weapons. You have to upgrade the building to the correct type by clicking on it when you have enough DNA. You need 200-300 DNA to build a building and 50-100 to upgrade.

## Missing assets

A number of the assets used to support development were paid assets and unfortunately we aren't able to distribute them here. For instance, the following assets are used but not included in this repo:

- Advanced Inspector
- Astar Pathfinding Project (free version)
- CSharp60Support
- FullInspector
- Lux 2.01 Personal
- NGUI
- TextMesh Pro
- Unitilities
- UniRx

## Limitations

- The AI is overly aggressive. This can lead to very short games
- There is no menu, when you win or lose the game exits
- There are no tool tips on the UI
- There are about 20 issues in our issue tracker still, although hopefully none are game breaking :P
